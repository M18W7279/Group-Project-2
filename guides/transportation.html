                <p>While you enter in Japan to know about the transportation is very much crucial. In this section I will discuss about the different types of transportation facilities and procedure of getting bus/train card and so on for student who visit japan firstly for study purpose in Kyoto</p>
                <p>In Kyoto, Taxi and City bus are easily available means of transportation. Because of limited money brought from home is not sufficient to travel here and there by taxi, it is so costly which impossible to afford by a student.

There is reservation seats in each bus like; people of ageing, pregnancy women, people with physical disability and women with small childrens. Inside the bus there a coin locker near to the driver side. If, you don’t have any types of transportation card you should put to the exact amount in this coin box. If you put the exact amount to the box it is easy to all the passenger to getoff from the bus. If you don’t have exact amount you can change the amount upto 1000 yen in this machine before getoff, but the machince doesnot accept the amount of 10,000 yen. The fare for bus in a time is 239 yen for adult and 120 yen for children and other special discount people like people have physical disabilities and ageign simply show their card to the driver is ok</p>

                <h2>Prepay or Postpay</h2>
                <p>Next things in bus need to know is previously pay or after pay. Most of the city bus have same method of paying meaning you should touch the card or pay the fare while you get out from the bus and need to enter from the back door but some bus have opposite method to pay , you should touch your card or pay the amount during  get-in the bus but at last while you get-out from the bus you can use the both door to out from the bus.

                <h2>Bus display information(on the way) and final stop /waiting</h2>
                <p>The available time of city bus in Kyoto City is normally 5 AM up to 11 PM later we cannot find public bus all over the city , need to hire  private vehicle at mid night which is so costly for a single person. So be careful about the available bus time is necessery to every person prevention from more transportation expenses</p>
                <p>Firstly, Each bus routes on the street there is a bus stop you should wait the respective bus in stop if there is queu in stop youshould stay last the person not stay at the front if you do this people are angry with you so you should follow the rule in each place. In each bus stop there is information box you should look carefully the route, bus time and bus number</p>
                <p>Tipically every bus stop in Kyoto have this types of information box. The box display recently coming bus. In each stop there is the display of bus number and status of arrival. Look at the box there are three circle in just down the bus number. The three curcle indicate the bus is how many station behind you for exemple if the highlited yellow is at the third circle this means the bus is 2 station far from you if, the highlited yellow color is in second circle the bus is 1 station far from you and if the yellow highlited yellow color is in the first circle this indicate the bus is approaching at your station so you should ready</p>
                <img src="../img/phadin/10.png" alt="information box" style="margin-left: 300px;">
                <p>Sometime in some bus stop not showing station but showing minutes for approaching is same as the above mention this means the last highlited yellow button indicate 5 minutes left to approaching respectively 3 and approach for second circle and first circle</p>
                <p>The next information we need to know is bus number and bus time. At the side of display box there is an image of bus schedule of whole day/week. Commonly all the time in week days is same but little bit different in Sunday and holidays. The bus commonly approach on time but some time due to the traffic and unexpected circumstances bus may delayed</p>
                <img src="../img/phadin/11.jpg" alt="schedule" width="100%">
                <p>Next thing in this display box have informatio about the bus routes with figure we should carefully look the figur before to decide the own bus route and bus number and make sure the bus travel according to the station display in figure. Instead of thes you can use google map to know about the location, bus number and time which is exact as this figue</p>
                <img src="../img/phadin/13.jpg" alt="route map" style="margin-left: 270px">
                <p>In the bus final station there is display button with code number , so make sure the bus number of your own and stay at line.
