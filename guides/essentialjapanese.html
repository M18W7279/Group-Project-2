                <h2>Katakana</h2>
                <p>Katakana is the second basic words of Japanese language which is little difficult then hiragana. Meaning of hiragana and katakana are same but the words writing is totally different. There is a three rules in katakana to write foreign words, sports name and country name. It’s more used to make sentences but little make confusion with hiragana because the meaning is same. And the table of katakana is not mention because it’s same as hiragana table</p>

                <p>According to the current situation Japanese language is more difficult for international students. Most of the students didn’t have the basic level of language. Hiragana and katakana is easy to write and understand but kanji is more difficult. If student’s take Japanese classes everyday one hour they were able to speak and understand. Most of student have some basic language level but it’s not enough to survived and find a better job.</p>

                <p>Our college KCGI always support from international students who are coming for further study. Most important part is college provide a basic language classes to improve the level of students. Class is focused on the development of student languages level. There is different kind of activity in class like writing Japanese words, personally question from teacher, discussion and test in a month. Another interesting things is that teacher gives present to good students in class and help each and every time. It was very funny and students did not feel boring in that classes. Another most important part is our college organized a different job hunting classes for international students which is helpful to find a job in future. Sometimes the guest lecture comes in that language and hunting classes to gives idea and knowledge to students. There is also a career center ( kcgi_career@kcg.ac.jp) in our KCGI college for the improvement of language and future of students.</p>
                <p>Finally our college always support for international students to make the future bright and have success in Japan. Students also have to attend all the language and job hunting classes provided by collage. If students labor hard, learn everyday language will be easy and makes the future success. Everything is possible in the world if people wants to do and take serious. It is true that without Japanese language there is no any chances to find a job and difficult to settle the further life in Japan. That’s why my suggestions for all international students is study Japanese language seriously.</p>
