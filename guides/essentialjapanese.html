                <p>The Japanese language is the ninth most spoken language is the world, with 128 million people speaking it as their first language in only two countries. Globally, Japanese is spoken by 128.3 million speakers</p>
                <p>I think Japanese is not easy but neither is it as difficult as people say it is. The main reason international students think it is difficult is that Japanese writing system has Kanji and two sets of alphabet called Hiragana and Katakana. While I agree that Kanji is difficult to master, Hiragana and Katakana should not be a problem at all. I have made detailed hiragana and katakana lessons in this website, with pronunciation demonstrations and mnemonics specially designed for English speakers, which I hope would make your learning process less painful and more enjoyable</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Three different Japanese words character</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Hiragana ( ひらがな)</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Katakana (カタカナ)</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Kanji (漢字)</p>
                <p>The Kyoto College of graduate studies for informatics KCGI, has been providing the education for different level, senbon or bachelor level, and graduate level. And graduate level is offered in two modes, Japanese and English modes. Where English medium is offered for international student. Language is offered to language student who are in japan for learning the Japanese language. And for the graduate level student language is offered at weekly basis for those who want to learn, Wednesday and Friday. But this seems insufficient because weekly a day class is not aiding for the improving the language. And weekly 3 classes if, organized then would be greatly assistance</p>

                <h2>Table of Sino-Japanese Number and Native Japanese Number</h2>
                <img src="../img/keshab/1.jpg" alt="NumberChart" width="100%">
                <p>There are two sets of numbers in Japanese: the native Japanese system and the Sino-Japanese system. The Sino-Japanese numbers are used in combination with counter words, when counting things, actions and events. The native Japanese numbers are usually only used up to 10. These numbers are used as counters for things which are not clearly categorized, or which have no defined shape, such as stones, boxes, stars, ideas, problems, etc. However, their usage differs from the normal counters, which combine a number with a specific counter term for the item being counted. Native numbers are used on their own when counting a relevant object. Sino-Japanese numbers are also used for counting something and using them as a numeral</p>

                <h2>Essential Japanese workds used in daily life</h2>
                <p>arigatou gozaimasu - Thank you very much</p>
                <p>onegaishimasu - Please</p>
                <p>sumimasen - Excuse me</p>
                <p>hai - Yes</p>
                <p>iie - No</p>
                <p>homen nasai - I'm Sorry</p>
                <p>wakarimasen - I don't understand</p>
                <p>nihongo ga wakarimasen - I don't understand Japanese</p>

                <p>Another reason why international students think Japanese is difficult is that the Japanese speak very fast. Yes, they do speak very fast. But that’s because the pronunciation system of Japanese is simpler than that of European languages. There are only five vowels in Japanese, namely, AIUEO. And it has fewer consonants than English does. As a result, to compensate for the lack of sound elements, the Japanese language has longer words. And one syllable words are very rare in Japanese. (That said, if i ask the Japanese people, most of them would say that English speakers speak too fast.) On the other hand, because Japanese has a simple sound system, it is very easy to speak understandable Japanese. Most of the time people will understand us even if the accent is funny. Japanese is such a magical language. If anybody want to come japan for travelling, further study or business language is most important in daily life.As the Asian economy rises, more opportunities for work would be available. Japanese is a language that is not commonly taught or studied, like French, German or Spanish. Learning Japanese will boost your professional value. When we learn Japanese, there will have less competition in opportunities available in different fields, such as business, social sciences, humanities, technology, science, journalism and tourism. If we want to be a translator for the government or a language services provider, our competition is lower when we speak Japanese compared to other more commonly taught language</p>
                <p>As a conclusion, easy or difficult is just a matter of trade-off. Every language is difficult but if we use in our daily life it can be easier. While Kanji is difficult to learn, and easy to use Hiragana and Katakana to write Japanese without the need to spell words. And while our ears suffer because the Japanese speak too fast, their tongue enjoys it because of the relatively simple sound system. If we practice daily we can understand and speak basic Japanese language. Globalization has opened new markets and allowed countries to engage in trade faster. However, there is always the problem of communication because nations speak different languages, which is why learning new languages in increasingly encouraged. Being able to speak different languages improves economic ties because communication is facilitated and understanding is enhanced. Some people just enjoy having a challenge and Japanese is definitely a challenge to acquire fluency. But it’s not impossible to learn, in facts, part of learning Japanese is quite easy. Japanese grammar are considered easier than some other languages. Understanding the Japanese Alphabets and writing system might be a challenge. It’s true that Japanese languages is most important for international students in daily life to stay in japan</p>
