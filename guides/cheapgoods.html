                <p>All over Japan there are thousands of 100-yen shops (100円ショップ, Hyaku En Shoppu) available. 100 yen shops are a kind of markdown store that sell a wide scope of items for 108 yen (100 yen in addition to 8 percent utilization charge). This compares generally to one US dollar, making these shops an extraordinary hotspot for explorers and occupants on a spending limit. Everything costs 100 yen in 100 yen shops. Government of Japan basically imposes 8% goods and service tax to its final consumer so it costs 108 yen which is not that much higher amount. We can see many franchisement of hundred yen shops all over Japan. We can see Lawson 100 Yen shops, 100 Yen Silk Shops, Daiso etc. as an example of 100 yen shops. Market pioneer Daiso works more than 3000 stores across the nation.</p>
                <p>They make their customer satisfied by providing daily essential products at very cheap rate. We can buy these product and services at 100 yen because these shops directly deal the transaction with the manufacturers and buy at a very low price because there is no supply chain in middle management. It means that these shops directly buy from manufacturers and sell to its final consumer. So that price becomes literally cheap. This product can fulfill people’s daily needs even make them satisfied. It is really good thing for us. Thus it is now a days first choice of every people in Japan. Many people including students are benefited from these shops. Thus it has been growing day by day. Number of 100 yen shops in every city has been growing day by day.</p>
