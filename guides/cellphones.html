                <p>The purpose of this guide is to give you direction and help you find a cheap second-hand smartphone in Kyoto. There are many stores both online and offline that sell second-hand phones and they come in various physical conditions. They can also be locked to certain networks or unlocked for you to use on any network. This guide will explain a bit about each, so you can decide which will work best for you.</p>

                <h2>NETWORK</h2>
                <p>Before looking for a phone I highly suggest you decide what data or voice plan that you want. Once you have selected a plan, you will know which network your phone will need to work on. For example, if you want to use AsahiNet, they only operate on the DoCoMo network. This means you have to buy either an unlocked phone or a DoCoMo phone. However, if you want to use QTmobile they have plans on AU, DoCoMo, and SoftBank. In this case, you could buy any phone you wanted. If you haven’t chosen a cell plan yet and would like help choosing one, please see my <a href="cellservice.html">Cell Service Guide</a> before proceeding.</p> 
                <h3>Network Locked</h3>
                <p>If a smartphone is a network or sim locked, it will only operate on a specific network. So first look for phones that are labeled for use on the network your chosen plan requires. Most stores will have a label telling you what network each phone works on.</p>
                <img src="../img/quinn/3.jpg" alt="AU Locked" width="49%">
                <img src="../img/quinn/4.jpg" alt="SoftBank Locked" width="49%" style="margin-left: 12px">
                <h3>Unlocked or SimFree</h3>
                <p>These phones aren’t locked to a specific network so you will be able to use them with any plan/sim card you want. The downside, however, is they are less common and typically more expensive. The upside is you are free to use any network, so if you ever decide to change to a different sim, plan, or network your choices won’t be limited.</p>

                <h2>Physical Condition</h2>
                <p>Most shops use a condition grading system. The exact definition varies from shop to shop of course, but here is the general idea of what to expect with each.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">[A] No Scratches on the screen, dents or dings</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">[B] Light scratches or dents from every day use</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">[C] Scratches on display, dents, dings or possible cracks but still fully functional</p>
                <p>As you would expect, higher grade phones are more expensive. As the phones get older, the price difference between the different grades gets smaller. So, check the price of each to see if it's worth spending a little extra on a better condition device. At the end of the day though once you put it in a case, most damage will be covered up anyway.</p>
                <p>Note: If you buy an iPhone, you should replace the battery if it hasn’t been replaced recently. You can purchase a new one online for around ¥1,000-¥1,500. Apple limits the performance of iPhones when the batteries age and start to degrade. A new battery can make a significant difference in the performance of an iPhone.

                <h2>Where to buy?</h2>
                <p>Now that you know what phone you want/need, where do you get it? There are many choices around Kyoto such as Dospara, Book Off, Sofmap, GEO, Hard off, etc. I suggest you start by checking google maps to see which of these stores are near you. You might encounter a sale or a special deal at one which is cheaper than the rest so, it is a good idea to shop around. If you don’t have the time or just want something fast then you may prefer shopping online. In that case, I suggest you try https://geo-mobile.jp/ as they specialize in second-hand phones and their website is easy to navigate.</p>
