                <p>For several 1st-time visitors, Japanese cultural values could be intimidating. But don't be amazed! A very complex code on decorum and culture has also been developed by Japan's 5000-year ancient civilization. And do not panic – you can easily manage the fundamental rules of the Japanese moral code with a small portion of society. But, you will also be pleased to know that the Japanese generally are pretty trying to excuse when visitors in the Etiquette Agency fuss about stuff. I read many customs and hygiene journals until I make my report to Japan to get prepared, and I'll be pleased to discuss what I've discovered. Here Is the Survival kit to Japanese Etiquette and Customs, from respectful forms of greeting to gaffe.</p>

                <h1>Meeting Etiquette</h1>
                <p>To relish the trip, it is important to know what to tell him to Japanese. That little Japanese understanding would not only offer many sighs, this also shows respect after interest in the culture.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Basic Japanese Greetings</h2>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;">Ohayo Gozaimasu - Good Morning / Hello</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;">Konnichiwa - Good Afternoon</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;">Konabanwa - Good Evening</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;">Oyasumi nasai - Good Night</p>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>To Bow or Not To Bow</h2>
                <p>Normally they bow each other rather than shaking the hands if Japanese meet, convey thanks or tell goodbye. A bow size relies on both the relative status and relationship of both the two individuals. Extranjeros won't even bother – if they're not lucky enough yet to meet the king – but it's so infectious, that you are about to fit in the best of them!! Japanese with such a greater knowledge of West traditions may give you a hand to stir, so treat it closely – they won't be expecting a solid grasp.</p>

                <p>Meals, whether beer or sake-don't eat alone, is often followed by drinks. Wait until the drink rises for your lips when you have a meal party and you will get drinks. Everyone's served, and someone's heading, lifting their beer, and yelling "Kampai! (Thanks). "(Best wishes). It is a bit uncomfortable to pour your drink throughout dinner parties. Giving anybody sip as well but hers and somebody are going to realize and fill yours. Shared bottles of vodka and sake were popular as this routine is an evening charm.</p>
