                <p>Opening a bank account is not easy for foreign students in Japan. Most banks have conditions to open an account like; you should have proper knowledge of the Japanese language (reading and writing) and have lived in Japan for at least 6 months. The second condition alone is sufficient for some banks</p>
                <p>But don’t worry you can open an account at Japan Post Bank (JP bank). They also have conditions for opening an account but your college sponsors you for this. The next option for an international student is, Shinsei Bank because you can use the English language with this bank, not only this but it is also easy for international transactions too.</p>

                <p>When opening a new bank account in Japan you need to have Residence Card with address verification, Hanko (personal seal) if you don’t have this, many banks won't accept a signature. Besides this, a student ID card and passport are necessary. Most banks require you to have a personal phone number to open an account, while you need a bank account to apply for many phone plans.  If you have the proper documents and the bank agrees to let you open an account, you should fill the different forms by yourself because the bank believes in self-contribution and to avoid unnecessary circumstances.</p>

                <p>After you fill out the form, you should turn it in at the counter according to your token number. If all of your documents are ok then the bank will provide a passbook meaning your account is open. But Shinsei bank doesn't provide a passbook, they only use cash cards instead. Most banks will ship an ATM or Cash Card to your home address after about 1 week. Shinsei bank will give it to you right away so you don't need to wait for the mail.</p>
