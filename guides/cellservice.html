                <h2>Major Carriers</h2>
                <p>DoCoMo, SoftBank, AU</p>
                <p>I <b>DO NOT</b> recommend you get a plan from one of these 3, their plans are crazy expensive compared to the MVNO options.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>MVNO’s</h2>
                <p>IIJmio, AsahiNet, AEON Mobile, ECJOY, HIS Mobile, Excite MOBILE, OCN Mobile ONE, QTmobile, J:COM, DMM mobile, DTI SIM, NifMo, b-mobile, nuro mobile, hi-ho, BIC SIM, BIC mobile ONE, BIGLOBE, mineo, Yamada New Mobile, UQ mobile, U-mobile, LINE Mobile, Rakuten Mobile, LIBMO, LinksMate, Rocket Mobile, Y-mobile</p>
                <p>As you can see there are quite a few companies to choose from and each has many different plans to choose from. There are plans as cheap as 500 yen a month and crazy expensive plans that are 11,000 yen or more per month. With so many options it’s hard to know where to start. This guide will help you through the process of finding the best plan for you. Or if you don’t want to go through all the trouble skip to the tl;dr section to see my top two suggestions.</p>

                <h1>Choosing a plan</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 1: Data? Voice? Or Both?</h2>
                <p>If you plan to only communicate using apps instead of traditional phone calls you can save some money by going with a data only sim. I don’t suggest this because there are a lot of times you will need a Japanese phone number such as signing up for a bank account, a credit card or getting a job.</p>    
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 2: Data</h2>
                <h3>Data Amount</h3>
                <p>There are data plans ranging from 500MB to 50GB and even unlimited. Word of warning though, the unlimited plans usually come with strict speed limits 0.2 – 0.7mbps so I wouldn’t suggest them.</p>
                <h3>Fair Usage Policy</h3>
                <p>In addition to how much data you want you also need to understand Fair Use Policy’s. In japan buying 10GB doesn’t always mean 10GB like it does in other countries. In japan some plans have what’s called a fair usage policy which places limits on how quickly you can use that data. Limits can be something like 1gb/3days where regardless of how much data you have, if you exceed 1GB of data in a 3-day period, your speed will be limited to 200kbps until the next 3-day period. This is very important to take note of, while some plans don’t have this type of limit others can be heavily limited.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 3: How many minutes?</h2>
                <p>Where I’m from you either get unlimited minutes or you pay per minute, nice and simple. Here in japan things are a bit more confusing and you need to decide what option works best for you. The 4 main options you will encounter are as follows:</p>
                <h3>Pay per 30 seconds</h3>
                <p>This is pretty self-explanatory, you will be charged per 30 seconds rounded up based on your call length. The typical rate is 21.6 yen per 30 seconds. (yeah, I really don’t understand why its 21.6 and not just 22)</p>
                <h3>5 minutes unlimited / 10 minutes unlimited</h3>
                <p>These are fairly common options where you can make unlimited calls up to 5 or 10 minutes in length. After your call exceeds 5 or 10 minutes you are charged per 30 seconds beyond that. Alternatively, you can just hang up and call back to avoid extra fees. This its an odd option but can be good if you make a lot of calls but they don’t last too long.</p>
                <p>NOTE: This only applies to calls within japan. If you call any number outside of Japan you will be charged long-distance fees. When calling other countries its better to use cheap or free online services/apps like skype.</p>
                <h3>Unlimited</h3>
                <p>While this does exist it’s not too common and usually pretty expensive. Just be careful and read the fine print, some plans say unlimited up front then in the fine print say unlimited calls up to 5 or 10 minutes.</p> 
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 4: Additional Considerations</h2>
                <h3>Combo Discounts</h3>
                <p>I won’t go too deep into this one because it depends on the internet situation of your particular apartment. My apartment has an NTT fiber connection, so I was able to get a ¥1,500/month discount by getting both my phone and fiber internet through NTT/NTT DoCoMo. So just keep this in mind when you look for a cell plan.</p>
                <h3>Share sim</h3>
                <p>Some companies allow you to get an extra sim card (for a small fee) so you can share your data plan with your tablet, laptop or even a friend. This can be really great if you have multiple devices but don’t want separate plans for each device.</p> 
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 5: Kakaku</h2>
                <p>Now that you have a solid idea of what you want head over to <a href="https://kakaku.com/">Kakaku.com</a>, click on the sim card section and punch in the details of what type of sim/minutes/data you want. Kakaku will then provide you with a list of the options that fit your needs.</p>  
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h1>tl;dr</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <p>Alright I get it, this might be a lot to take in and you just want an easy way out. So here are the 2 options that I personally find the most compelling. This is purely my opinion and shouldn’t be treated as the definitive answer.</p>
                <h3>LINE Mobile</h3>
                <p>500 ¥</p> 
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Unlimited calls and messages through LINE</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Unlimited access to LINE, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">1GB Data for anything else</p>
                <p>1,200 ¥</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">500 yen plan + Normal phone number</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Like I said earlier you are really going to want a Japanese phone number, so definitely go for this instead of the 500¥ option. I just put that one there because it insanely cheap and I want you to know the option is there.</p>
                <h3>BIGLOBE</h3>
                <p>3,880 ¥</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Voice + 12GB Data</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">YouTube, AbemaTV, U-NEXT, Spotify, Google Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Line Music and Facebook messenger don’t count towards data use</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Biglobe has many plans but this is my favorite because it gives a good amount of data and YouTube doesn’t count towards data usage.</p>
