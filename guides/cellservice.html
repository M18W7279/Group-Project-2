                <h2>Major Carriers</h2>
                <p>DoCoMo, SoftBank, AU</p>
                <p>I <b>DO NOT</b> recommend purchasing a plan from one of these three. Their plans are expensive compared to MVNO options.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>MVNO’s</h2>
                <p>IIJmio, AsahiNet, AEON Mobile, ECJOY, HIS Mobile, Excite MOBILE, OCN Mobile ONE, QTmobile, J:COM, DMM mobile, DTI SIM, NifMo, b-mobile, nuro mobile, hi-ho, BIC SIM, BIC mobile ONE, BIGLOBE, mineo, Yamada New Mobile, UQ mobile, U-mobile, LINE Mobile, Rakuten Mobile, LIBMO, LinksMate, Rocket Mobile, Y-mobile</p>
                <p>As you can see there are quite a few companies to choose from and each has many different plans to choose from. There are plans as cheap as ¥500 per month and crazy expensive plans that are ¥11,000 or more per month. With so many options it’s hard to know where to start. This guide will help you through the process of finding the best plan for you. Or if you don’t want to go through all the trouble skip to the tl;dr section to see my top two suggestions.</p>

                <h1>Choosing a plan</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 1: Data? Voice? Or Both?</h2>
                <p>If you plan to only communicate using apps instead of traditional phone calls you can save some money by going with a data-only sim. I don’t suggest this because there are a lot of times you will need a Japanese phone number such as signing up for a bank account, a credit card or getting a job.</p>    
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 2: Data</h2>
                <h3>How much?</h3>
                <p>Data plans range from 500MB to 50GB and some even offer unlimited. A word of warning though, the unlimited plans usually come with strict speed limits 0.2–0.7mbps so I wouldn’t suggest using them.</p>
                <h3>Fair Usage Policy</h3>
                <p>In addition to how much data you want, you also need to understand the fair usage policies. In Japan, 10GB doesn’t always mean 10GB as it does in other countries. Some plans have what’s called a fair usage policy. This policy limits how quickly you can use your data. Limits can be something like 1gb/3days where regardless of how much data you have if you exceed 1GB of data in 3 days, your speed will be limited to 200kbps until the next 3-day period. This is important to take note of because while some plans don’t have this type of limit, others can be heavily limited.</p>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 3: Voice</h2>
                <p>In my home country, you either have the option of unlimited or pay per minute. In Japan, things are a bit more confusing, and you need to decide what option works best for you. The four main options you will encounter are as follows:</p>
                <h3>Pay per 30 seconds</h3>
                <p>This is pretty self-explanatory, you will be charged per 30 seconds based on your call's length. The typical rate is ¥21.6 per 30 seconds.</p>
                <h3>5 Minutes Unlimited / 10 Minutes Unlimited</h3>
                <p>These are relatively common options that allow you to make unlimited calls up to 5 or 10 minutes in length. If your call exceeds 5 or 10 minutes, you will be charged per 30 seconds beyond that. Alternatively, you can hang up and call back to avoid extra fees. These can be a good option if you make a lot of calls and they are normally short.</p>
                <p>NOTE: This only applies to calls made within Japan. If you call any number outside of Japan, you will be charged long-distance fees. When calling other countries, it’s better to use cheap or free online services like skype.</p>
                <h3>Unlimited</h3>
                <p>While this option does exist it’s not common and usually pretty expensive. Be careful and read the fine print, some plans say unlimited upfront than in the fine print they say unlimited up to 5 or 10 minutes.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Additional Considerations</h2>
                <h3>Combo Discounts</h3>
                <p>I won’t go too deep into this one because it depends on the internet situation of your particular apartment. My apartment has an NTT fiber connection, so I was able to get a ¥1,500/month discount by getting both my phone and fiber internet through NTT/NTT DoCoMo. So just keep this in mind when you look for a cell plan.</p>
                <h3>Share Sim</h3>
                <p>Some companies allow you to get an extra sim card (for a small fee) so you can share your data plan with your tablet, laptop, or even a friend. This can be great if you have multiple devices but don’t want separate data plans for each device.</p> 
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h2>Step 5: Kakaku</h2>
                <p>Now that you have a solid idea of what you want, head over to <a href="https://kakaku.com/">Kakaku.com</a>, click on the sim card section and punch in the details of what type of sim/minutes/data you want. Kakaku will then provide you with a list of the options that fit your needs.</p>  
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h1>tl;dr</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <p>This can be a lot to take in, and you may want an easy way out. So here are the two options that I believe are the most compelling. This is purely my opinion and shouldn’t be treated as the definitive answer.</p>
                <h3>LINE Mobile</h3>
                <p>¥500</p> 
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Unlimited calls and messages through LINE</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Unlimited access to LINE, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">1GB Data for anything else</p>
                <p>¥1,200</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">¥500 Plan + A normal phone number</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Like I said earlier you are going to want a Japanese phone number, so definitely go for this instead of the ¥500 option. I just put that one there because it’s insanely cheap and I want you to know the option is there.</p>
                <h3>BIGLOBE</h3>
                <p>¥3,880</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">Voice + 12GB Data</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">YouTube, AbemaTV, U-NEXT, Spotify, Google Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Line Music, and Facebook Messenger do not count towards data use</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 60px">BIGLOBE has many plans but this is my favorite because it gives a good amount of data and YouTube doesn’t count towards data usage.</p>
